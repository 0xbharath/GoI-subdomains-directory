## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Why aggregate subdomains/web applications by GoI?

> National Informatics Centre (NIC) provides infrastructure to help support the delivery of Indian government IT services and the delivery of some of the initiatives of Digital India.

As per my knowledge, unlike [other](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls) [government agencies](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-gov-uk-domain-names) NIC doesn't maintain a directory of all the subdomains/web applications.

Having a list of subdomains/web applications maintained by government will help organisations that perform studies on those websites or verify their privacy protection using scoring tools like [Webbkoll](https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net).
